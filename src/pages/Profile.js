                    Hi! I'm Hal.ðŸ‘‹ I've got a lot of interests in life -- JavaScript, backpacking, turn-based RPGs, <MusicDetails />, and someday finally tiring out my border collie. I'm proudly from some random town in Ohio, where I earned my Bachelor's degree, and am currently living in Seattle, where I taught software engineering at Flatiron School for nearly 2 years.

                    <br></br>
                    While I have a real love for training and education, I'm making the move to use my compassionate ear and software engineering expertise as a part of an engineering team, so I can spend more time exploring & expanding my technical interests. If you've made it here, feel free to drop a line -- I'd love to discuss what brought you.
