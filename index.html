        <h2>How It's Maid: Websites</h2>
        <p>I didn't want to run into any copyright issues, so I just spelled the TV Show title wrong. Now, this blog will largely be about Ruby and how you can use that amazing language to accomplish really amazing things, or really silly things, or what have you. But for the first post here I’ll be detailing what it takes to build a site, because that’s what took up the large part of my spare time for this week. </p>

        <p>Also because it’s interesting. A friend of mine used to say, “You should never ignore a curious urge, a creative urge, or an urge to brush your teeth.” You really can't go wrong with that one.</p>
        
        <p>The steps I took to building a website were a little haphazard, as self-teaching tends to be. The first thing I did was purchase a domain, from the only domain-purchasing site I knew offhand, <a href="www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy.com</a>. I wish I’d chosen a different one, but I was excited at the idea of getting started so I just went with it. Daddy is just such a terrible word. </p>
        
        <p>**In future posts I might try to explore the ins-and-outs of how URL hoarding happens — the idea that one company can sit on the URL pile like a jealous dragon and hand them out to the highest bidder can’t be right, but that’s of course what I’m envisioning. **</p>
        
        <p>So, I have a domain. What’s next? Youtube videos. I watched a few different 20-minute submissions on how to start a website from scratch using HTML and CSS. I think I got a pretty good handle on how to put up some boxes with text and solid colors.</p>
